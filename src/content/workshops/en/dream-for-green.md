description: "🧪 Lab 1 : Aqua melody\n💧 Have you ever wonder what it takes to make our drinking and bathing water safe?\nIn this workshop, you'll get hands-on experience measuring water quality using real tools used by environmental engineers. You'll also see a demonstration of basic water treatment models and learn how engineers clean and restore water to make it safe again.\n✨ Highlight: You'll discover that \"clear water\" isn't always \"clean water,\" and that water treatment is a combination of science and engineering.\n\n🌬️ Lab 2: Air beat\n🌫️ How the air we breathe is important?\nLet's explore real-world air pollution issues like PM2.5, toxic gases (NOx, SOx, CO, O₃), and their impacts on health and the environment. Also learning about cutting-edge air quality monitoring technologies — from PM2.5 sensors to real-time air analysis systems.\n✨ Highlight: You'll realize that \"clean air\" doesn't happen by accident — it takes policy, technology, and public action.\n\n🌟 Lab 3 : Green Spotlight\n🎶 Every stage needs a spotlight… and nature has its own hidden stage!\nIn this workshop, you'll use a microscope to discover the unseen world within our environment. Explore tiny life and hidden connections that play a big role in ecosystems and sustainability.\n✨ Expect excitement, fresh knowledge, and a whole new perspective on the \"green world\" around you.\n✨Highlight: See how nature's smallest performers still shine bright under the spotlight each one vital to the show of life.\n\n🌍 Lab 4: Light step\n👣 The footprints we leave on the Earth aren't just on the ground — they're also carbon footprints we create in daily life.\nHere, you'll calculate your own carbon footprint from everyday activities like eating and traveling. You'll also learn how small lifestyle changes can lead to big environmental impacts. Moreover, We'll connect it all to the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) — to show how your small actions contribute to the world's biggest goals.\n✨ Highlight: See clearly how \"tiny lifestyle changes\" can truly help save the planet — and feel empowered to make a difference."
